/**
 * T-ROO-14 to T-ROO-23 — the acceptance criteria, run against the composed system.
 *
 * Everything here goes through the root's own entry point: `createHost()` builds the real agent
 * list, the real pipeline and the real adapters, and the only thing replaced is where the homes
 * are. Every home is a throwaway directory created for the test and removed afterwards, and
 * `HOME` moves with them, so no test reads the user's own sessions or settings (C-3).
 *
 * The nine directions land into homes of their own, so the seeded source homes are never written
 * to by an import. That is what lets T-ROO-17 compare them byte for byte afterwards.
